 
 basic poll application.
 
 2 parts 
 - public site that lets them see the poll and vote in them 
 - admin site lets me add , change , delete polls 
 
 
 install 
 - pip 
 - django 
   either create a virtualenv first then , or ' pip install django' : worked for me globally . 
   
  create an app : 
  you’ll need to auto-generate some code that establishes a Django project – a collection of settings
  for an instance of Django, including database configuration, Django-specific options and application
  -specific settings.
  
  set up : 
  mkdir DJANGO
  cd DJANGO
  django-admin startproject mysite
  produces : 
  mysite directory
  // avoid names in django OR PYTHON
  
  structure formed 
  mysite/
    manage.py 
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
  
  
  about : 
  
  1. manage.py : ::command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. 
  2.mysite/ directory is the actual Python package for your project.
  3.  __init__.py: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package

  ***
  
  
  outter mysite run :
  python manage.py runserver
  creates : db.sqlite3
  
  then in the same directory : 
  run : 'python manage.py startapp polls'
  
  creats poll in .
  structure : 
  polls/
