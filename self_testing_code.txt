self testing code refers to the practice of writing comphrehensive automated tests in conjunction with functional software .
if properly done allows to invoke a single command that executes the tests .and these tests will illuminate any bugs hiding in the code 

EVERY OBJECT SHOULD BE ABLE TO TEST ITSELF .

YOU have a self testing code when you can run a series of automated tests against the code base and be confident that 
if the test pass the code is free of any substantial defect .

other way of thinking it is as you building the software system simultaneously build a bug detector system .

ANY NON TRIVIAL CODE WITHOUT TESTS IS BROKEN.
 
Self testing code is part of continous integration . as well as necessary for continous dilivery .

benifit not only that you are avoiding production bugs also the confidence when u make some change .
hence you end up being in a virtuous spiral.

- TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT 
Continuous Delivery allows you to quickly deploy new versions of software into production.
teams put in more effort in spoting bugs once in production , rapidly fixing them by deploying a new fixed version or rolling 
back to the last best version .
